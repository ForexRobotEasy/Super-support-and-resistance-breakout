## Functionality
The program includes the following functions:

1. `identifySupportResistanceZones()`: This function is responsible for identifying and calculating support and resistance zones. Traders can customize this function to fit their own trading strategies.

2. `performMarketAnalysis()`: This function performs market analysis based on the identified support and resistance zones. Traders can add their own analysis techniques within this function.

3. `implementDeviationBackStep()`: This function implements the 'Deviation Back-step' feature, which allows traders to adjust the sensitivity of the support and resistance zones. Traders can modify this function to suit their preferences.

4. `optimizeCode()`: This function optimizes the code for performance and efficiency. Traders can add their own optimization techniques within this function.

5. `displayUserInterface()`: This function displays a user-friendly interface for traders to interact with the program. Traders can customize the interface design and functionality within this function.

The main program flow consists of the following steps:

1. Initialization: The `OnInit()` function is called for program initialization. Traders can add their own initialization code within this function.

2. Function Execution: The necessary functions (`identifySupportResistanceZones()`, `performMarketAnalysis()`, `implementDeviationBackStep()`, `optimizeCode()`, and `displayUserInterface()`) are called to perform their respective tasks.

3. Program Conclusion: The necessary code for the logical conclusion of the program can be added within the `OnStart()` function.

4. Program Exit: The program exits after all tasks are completed.
